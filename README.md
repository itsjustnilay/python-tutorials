# Basic Python Coding Tutorials

Welcome to the **Basic Python Coding Tutorials** repository! üéâ This repository is designed to help you learn and practice Python programming, starting from the very basics. Whether you're new to programming or revisiting Python fundamentals, this is the perfect place to start.

## üìñ What You'll Learn

- Python syntax and structure
- Variables and data types
- Control flow (if statements, loops)
- Functions and modular programming
- Working with lists, dictionaries, and sets
- File handling basics
- Intro to object-oriented programming (OOP)
- And much more!

Each tutorial includes:
- Clear explanations
- Code examples
- Exercises to practice what you've learned


## üõ† Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itsjustnilay/basic-python-tutorials.git
   cd basic-python-tutorials
   ```

## üõ† Set up Your Environment

Ensure you have Python installed (3.7 or later is recommended). You can check your Python version with the following command:

```bash
python --version
```
If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).


### Create a Virtual Environment

To keep your project dependencies organized, it's a good practice to use a virtual environment. Here's how:

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   Run the following command to create a virtual environment named `env`:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
   ```bash
   .\env\Scripts\activate
   ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
  After activation, you should see the environment name (e.g., (env)) in your terminal prompt.


3. **Deactivate the virtual environment**: When you're done working, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```
